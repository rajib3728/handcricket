        <p class="txt1">1. The game is played between two players, the user and the bot (or another human).</p>
        <p class="txt1">2. The game starts with a coin toss to determine
    who will bat first. The user can choose heads (H) or tails (T).</p>
        <p class="txt1">3. The player who wins the toss can choose to
    either bat or bowl first.</p>
        <p class="txt1">4. The batting player will choose a number between
    1 and 6, representing the runs they want to score.</p>
        <p class="txt1">5. The bowling player will also choose a number between
    1 and 6, representing the runs they want to concede.</p>
        <p class="txt1">6. If the batting player's chosen number matches the
    bowling player's chosen number, the batting player is out.</p>
        <p class="txt1">7. If the batting player's chosen number does not match
    the bowling player's chosen number, the batting player scores
    runs equal to the chosen number.</p>
        <p class="txt1">8. The game continues until the batting player is out or
    reaches a predetermined score limit.</p>
        <p class="txt1">9. The player with the highest score at the end of the
    game wins.</p>
        <p class="txt1">10. In the case of a tie, the game
    can be decided by a tiebreaker, such as a super over or a coin toss.</p>
